*The* game Factorio is a notoriously fast-paced action-packed game that leaves no room for planning. It's poorly optimized, and has so little content that the entire game can be completed in one sitting.

*Factory*-building is fixed, with Factorio Idle! This mod slows down the pace of the game by 100-fold, fixing UPS issues, while keeping the hustle and bustle of your operating factory unchanged. What was once a few hours of content is now hundreds of hours of content! 

*Must*-have features have been added! Including:
 - Placing a building requires 100 copies of the item in your inventory
 - Research costs 100x as much
 - Biters evolve 100x slower and do not expand
 - Permanent and semi-permanent fixtures have 100x HP. This includes buildings, natural trees, rocks, biter nests, vehicles, and demolishers. The health buff is not applied to temporary factory components, such as biters, planted trees, and engineers.
 - Naturally generated structures take 100x longer to mine and yield 100x the resources.
 - Naturally generated resources are 100x as rich
 - Spoilage rots 10x slower
 - Engineer corpses rot 100x slower, and 10x slower on top of that since they are considered spoilage
 - Weapons, modules, armor, vehicles, and bots cost 100x to make. Everything else has its stack size increased by 100x

*Grow* your factory incrementally with Factorio Idle! Take 24 hours to do what you could've done in 15 minutes! Handcraft thousands of items before automating anything! Mine a large rock for 5 minutes! Experience pride and accomplishment upon researching electric mining drills, which takes 2 days to accomplish! why did I make this lol
